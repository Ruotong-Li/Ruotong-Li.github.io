# Hello, I’m Ruotong Li

*Ph.D. Student in Applied Economics, University of Minnesota*

I study agri-food value chains, labor markets, and development economics.  
My work explores how market structures, labor dynamics, and public policy shape economic opportunities and sustainability.

- 🌾 I use data-driven methods — econometrics, simulation, and network modeling — to study global food systems.  
- 👩‍💻 I also contribute to projects on early childhood education, women’s employment, and labor mobility in the Middle East.
